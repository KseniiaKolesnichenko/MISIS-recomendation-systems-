## Description

Real-time optimization of drilling paramete rs during drilling operations aims to optimize weight on bit, bit rotation speed for obtaining maximum drilling rate as well
as minimizing the drilling cost.

The process is considered to be formation specific. A statistical method such as mu ltiple linear regression technique has been used for the drilling optimization. An xtensive litera ture survey on drilling optimization was conducted for this research study.

A model is developed for this purpose using actual field data collected through modern well monitoring and data recording systems, which predicts the rate of drilling penetra tion as a function of available parameters. The rate of penetration general equation is optimized for effective functions at each data point. In order to optimize the parame ters in the field, a computer network is required to be developed.

The computer network will keep the piped data directly from the data source, and continuously be collecting the new data to be fed. A database present at the central comput er will be continuously calculating the developed model parameters by means of multiple regression technique and inform the team at the field. The field engineer will transmit the current drilling parameters back to the central comput er, and the headquarters will determine the new model parameters and optimum drilling parameters by including the recently received information. Therefore, there will be a real-time-optimization process. It is considered that this technique is going to be widely used in future drilling activities since it could reduce drilli ng costs and minimize proba bility of encountering problems due to working with optimized parameters.

It has been found that drilling rate of pe netration could be modelled in real-time environment as a function of independent dr illing variables such as weight on bit,
rotation speed of the string, drilling fluid weight, and formation characteristics. The ability to have the drilling rate of penetration with respect to depth aracteristically with certain parameters for specific form ations on real-time basis could bring new insights to the nature of drilling optimization studies. Any significant departure of the actual rate of penetration from the predicted rate of pe netration trend could have important indications which could be detected beforehand in real-time. The study has also achieved one of its objectives, giving the optimized independent drilling parameters found following statistical synthesis.
## Final effect

Based on the results of our work, a presentation was made for the customer with recommendations for fast and trouble-free drilling of the future well. At the current well, this approach will save up to 25% of the cost of the well in terms of one well per month about 5 million rubles or in terms of the entire Russian drilling volume of 45,000 million rubles per year!!!
