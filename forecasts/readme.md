Data analysis in order to predict the average mechanical speed also showed the presence of a weak linear relationship with the signs factors and the feasibility of the following actions:
1) There is a sense of analysis in the context of stratigraphy codes
2) At the same time, it is necessary to carry out extensive work on data preprocessing:
a. Get rid of outliers
b. Look for nonlinear dependencies within the features.
3) So, for the stratigraphy code 361, the logarithmic transformation showed the appearance of a connection with "rotor speed" = 0.72, "well number" = 0.53, "bit load" = 0.4.
The current findings allow us to make recommendations on the choice of technological modes, taking into account the stratigraphic division of rocks.
